# Bone Fracture Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks
Developing a CNN to classify whether an X-Ray image of a bone is fractured or not fractured (1 or 0). Using Streamlit for interface.

1. Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/miguelfa77/Bone-Fracture-Classifier.git```
2. Install dependencies: ```pip3 install -r requirements.tx```
3. Run the streamlit app: ```streamlit run app/app.py```

Model can also be altered/retrained or tested against the test set inside ```binary_image_classifier.py```
